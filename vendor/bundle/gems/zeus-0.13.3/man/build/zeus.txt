NAME
       zeus - boot rails in under a second

SYNOPSIS
       zeus [--no-color] COMMAND [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       Zeus makes working with large codebases much less painful.

       To  use	Zeus  with  Ruby  on  Rails  3.0+, Just run zeus start in your
       project directory. It will output a list of available commands, includ-
       ing tasks to spawn consoles, servers, tests, and rake tasks.

       See    https://github.com/burke/zeus/blob/master/docs/ruby/modifying.md
       for information on modifying the boot process that Zeus uses by default
       and adding custom tasks.

SLIGHTLY MORE TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
       Zeus  is  a  language-agnostic  application checkpointer for non-multi-
       threaded applications.

       It is primarily targeted at ruby and  other  dynamic  languages,  where
       application  boot  time	can  be tens of seconds, but it can be made to
       work for nearly any language. However, zeus does  not  work  well  with
       multithreaded  applications.  It  relies  heavily  on fork(2), which is
       largely incompatible with multithreaded systems.

       Currently only ruby is targeted, but support  for  other  languages  is
       planned.

       Zeus  lets  you	define	common	tasks, and preloads all of them in the
       background. When you ask to run them, zeus transparently connects  your
       terminal to the already-running process in milliseconds.

       This  lets  you, for example, run unit tests in dozens of milliseconds,
       rather than dozens of seconds.

       Zeus also monitors all files loaded by your application,  and  restarts
       parts of it when dependencies change, to keep everything up-to-date.
